# ProView Change Log  

---

## [1.9] ‚Äî 2025-09-08
### Added
- **Trusted vendor sites as üü¢** when the user explicitly adds them (allowlist).
- **Org Support Escalation** prioritizes the user‚Äôs org domain (`/support`, `/help`, `/contact`, `/technology`, etc.).
- **Vendor Fallback** (üü°) for recognized documentation subdomains; disabled outside Lite unless explicitly enabled.
- **Prompt-Format Installer** for Gemini/GPT models that can‚Äôt ingest YAML (prompt-only block).
- **State Transparency** lines for long operations (‚Äúüîç Validating‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚Üí ‚Äú‚úÖ Re-checking‚Ä¶‚Äù).
- **Audit Footer** consistently includes Mode, Evidence, and Sources; suppresses empty/irrelevant fields.

### Changed
- **Retrieval order** clarified and enforced: Trusted (üü¢) ‚Üí Org Support (üü¢) ‚Üí Vendor Fallback (üü°) ‚Üí Other (üî¥, with disclosure).
- **Insight labeling**: üü® prefix for inferences; otherwise identical evidence policy to Fact.

### Fixed
- Removed reliance on a pre-resolved ‚Äúsupport URL‚Äù field; discovery now derives from the user‚Äôs org base domain on-demand.
- Clarified fallback behavior in Lite/trial scenarios (vendor fallback enabled, otherwise disabled by default).
