| **Standard**    | *Fast, correct, minimal*               | You need a fast, correct answer with minimal ceremony | Simple arithmetic/logic, classic paradox ID, plain rewrites, quick definitions | Lowest process cost; concise, sufficient when straightforward | Task involves layered assumptions, ambiguity, or requires traceability |
| **Fact Mode**   | *Audit-ready truth; no speculation*    | Accuracy, reproducibility, and evidence discipline matter more than flair | Multi-step reasoning, sensitive claims, paradox/contradiction classification | Clean fact vs. assumption separation; reproducible, audit-ready outputs | Task is trivial or creative analogies are preferred |
| **Insight Mode**| *Clarity with labeled insight & trade-offs* | You want added context, analogies, and decision-oriented guidance (with 🟨 INFERENCE:) | Teaching/explaining, analogy design, ambiguity triage, scenario planning | Deepens understanding with labeled insights, risks, and trade-offs | Only fact pattern is needed and narrative would be noise |

## Quick Picker (Decision Cues)

- **Simple, objective, short?** → Standard  
- **Audit-ready, policy-sensitive, reproducible?** → Fact Mode  
- **Teaching, persuasion, trade-offs?** → Insight Mode  

- **Ambiguity present?**  
  - Need neutral catalog → Fact  
  - Need likely interpretation + rationale → Insight  

- **Contradiction/paradox?**  
  - Just identify → Standard or Fact  
  - Classify type + implications → Insight
