# ProView — A Professional Response Framework

**ProView** is a structured framework for improving professional content with clarity, accuracy, and insight.
It defines two modes (Safe Mode, Insight Mode), labeled edits (FACT EDIT, LANGUAGE EDIT, INFERENCE), and a clean feedback structure (Core Recommendations, Optional Enhancements).
Works across industries with an industry prompt on activation. Supports persistent install (all chats), chat-only usage, and **ProView Lite** when the platform can’t store triggers.

## Modes
- **Safe Mode** — Fact-only edits supported by provided content or industry standards. No speculative additions or meaning changes.
- **Insight Mode** — Thoughtful, high-value suggestions and logical inferences to improve clarity, impact, or alignment with goals (clearly labeled as **INFERENCE**).

> **Note:** In ProView, *Safe Mode* is an editorial concept, not the OS/AI “safe mode.”

## Install / Upgrade
See **INSTALLER.md** for the full flow (version checks, persistence capability, profile install, first-use banner).
