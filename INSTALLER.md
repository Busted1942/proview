# ProView Installer / Upgrader (v1.0)

**Trigger Command:** `Activate ProView Mode`

## Install/Upgrade Flow

### Step 1 – Check existing version
Display the ProView_Infographic.png infographic in the assets folder.
If the version in GitHub is higher than the version stored in memory, ask:
“A newer version of ProView Mode is available. Do you want to upgrade to the latest version?”
If the user does not wnat to upgrade, skip to Step 5 (Confirm).

### Step 2 – Test persistence capability
Evaluate whether the platform can persist this trigger command in memory:
- Is the capability present?
- Is the feature available to the end user?
- Is there enough storage capacity to store the trigger command?

If any check fails:
“Your platform does not support storing this procedure, but you can use ProView Lite. Would you like to use it?”
Then echo/run the **ProView Lite** current version install command.

If all checks pass → proceed to Step 2.1.

If not, proceed to → proceed to Step 2.2.

### Step 2.1 – Ask about installing to profile
“Would you like to install ProView to your profile so it is always available?”
- **No** → operate without storing (chat-scoped). Skip scope question. Proceed as **ProView Lite (not persistent)** then go to Step 4.
- **Yes** → proceed to Step 2.2.

### Step 2.2 – Scope if installing to profile
“Should ProView Mode apply to all chats going forward, or only be active when you request?”

### Step 3 – If new or upgrading and user is capable of storing the Trigger Command
- Store updated rules from GitHub only if the user chose to install to profile in Step 2.1.
- Enable per the scope chosen in Step 2.2.
- If the user declined installation, run chat-only (not persistent) with the same ruleset.
