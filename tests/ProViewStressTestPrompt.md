# Bakeoff_Test

## Objective
Run a side-by-side demo with three modes:
- Standard (left column)
- ProView Fact Mode (middle column)
- ProView Insight Mode (right column)

## Instructions
1. Answer each question step by step in all three modes.
2. Clearly explain reasoning in each mode.
3. If you encounter ambiguity, paradox, or contradiction, call it out.
4. Label each scenario as:
   - **Baseline** = simple logic, contradiction, or classic paradox
   - **Differentiated** = multi-step, ambiguity, analogy, audience-adaptation, or governance
5. Do not self-evaluate yet; stop after answering all questions.
6. Format results in a Markdown table titled: **"Unified Comparison Table with Metrics"**
7. Each column must include:
   - **Full Response** (start each answer on new line using `<br>`)
   - **Core Recommendations**
   - **Optional Enhancements**
   - **Metrics** (Quality, PCS, Tokens, Turnaround, Cognitive Load, ER)
