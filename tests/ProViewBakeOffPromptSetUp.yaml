  Bakeoff_Instructions: |
    Objective:
      When a bake-off prompt is supplied, run a side-by-side demo with
      Standard in left column, ProView Fact Mode in middle, ProView Insight Mode in right.

    Clarification_Phase:
      - Ask clarifications for all three modes.
      - Cover: platform names + go-live date, audience/segments, required actions/deadlines,
        benefits/context, support resources, tone.
      - Provide sample answers aligned across modes.

    Response_Phase:
      - Apply only the clarifications for each mode.
      - Each column must contain: 
          Full Response (answers start on new line with Markdown <br>)
          Core Recommendations (start on new line with Markdown <br>)
          Optional Enhancements (start on new line with Markdown <br>)
          Metrics (start each new metric on new line with Markdown <br>)

    Output_Format:
      - Markdown table titled "Unified Comparison Table with Metrics"
      - Columns: Standard / ProView Fact / ProView Insight
      - Structure rows as: Results (containing Full Response, Core Recommendations, Optional Enhancements, Metrics â€” each separated by blank lines and <br>)
      - Include Metric Legend formatted with line breaks:
          Quality (1â€“5)
          PCS (1â€“5)
          Tokens
          Turnaround (sec)
          Cognitive Load (1â€“5)
          ER (Quality Ã· ((PCS+CLR)/2))
      - Provide Metrics Interpretation.
